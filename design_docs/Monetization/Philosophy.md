# Monetization Philosophy

## Core Principles

### Fair Play Foundation
- **No Pay-to-Win**: Premium purchases never provide gameplay advantages
- **Equal Experience**: All players can access core gameplay features
- **Balanced Progression**: [[../Balance/Progression|Progression systems]] remain fair regardless of spending
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear communication about what purchases provide

### Player-First Approach
- **Respect Player Choice**: All purchases are optional enhancements
- **Value-Driven**: Every purchase provides clear, meaningful value
- **Long-term Relationship**: Focus on player satisfaction over short-term revenue
- **Age-Appropriate**: Suitable monetization for all target audiences

## Ethical Guidelines

### What We Will Do
- Offer cosmetic enhancements and convenience features
- Provide clear value propositions for all purchases
- Maintain game balance regardless of player spending
- Support refunds and customer service
- Regularly evaluate pricing fairness

### What We Won't Do
- Sell gameplay advantages or power
- Create artificial scarcity or pressure
- Target vulnerable players with aggressive tactics
- Hide costs or use deceptive practices
- Compromise game balance for revenue

## Implementation Standards

### Purchase Categories
- **Cosmetic Only**: Visual enhancements with no gameplay impact
- **Convenience Features**: Time-saving tools that don't affect balance
- **Content Access**: Additional content that doesn't create advantages

### Balance Protection
- All premium items must pass [[../Balance/Economy|economic balance]] review
- No premium items in [[../Economy/Stocks|stocks system]] that create advantages
