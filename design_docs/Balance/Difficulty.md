# Difficulty Scaling

## Overview

Difficulty scaling ensures the game remains challenging and engaging for players of all skill levels throughout their progression.

## Scaling Philosophy

### Accessibility First
- Game designed for all audiences (young and old)
- Simple core mechanics with deeper optional complexity
- Multiple paths to success

### Progressive Complexity
- [To be defined]
- Gradual introduction of complex systems
- Optional advanced mechanics for experienced players

## Difficulty Dimensions

### Economic Complexity
