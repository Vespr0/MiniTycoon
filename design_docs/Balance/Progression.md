# Progression Balance

## Level System Balance

### XP Requirements
- [To be defined]
- Should integrate with the leveling system described in [[../Core/Progression]]
- Must scale appropriately to maintain engagement

### Level Pacing
- [To be defined]  
- Balance between too fast (trivial) and too slow (frustrating)
- Consider different player engagement levels

## Item Unlock Progression

### Rarity Integration
- [To be defined]
- Must work with the [[../Core/Items#Item Rarity System|rarity system]]
- Ensure rare items feel special but not mandatory

### Shop Algorithm Balance
- [To be defined]
- Should consider the [[../Economy/Shop#Offers System|offers algorithm]]
- Prevent exploitation while maintaining fairness

### Unlock Gates
- [To be defined]
- Level requirements for items
- Alternative unlock methods (achievements, etc.)

## Progression Curves

### Early Game (Levels 1-10)
- [To be defined]
- Fast initial progression for engagement
- Clear tutorial and guidance

### Mid Game (Levels 11-50)  
- [To be defined]
- Steady progression with meaningful unlocks
- Introduction of complex mechanics

### Late Game (Levels 50+)
- [To be defined]
- Slower but rewarding progression
- Prestige or advanced systems

## Balance Validation

### Testing Metrics
- [To be defined]
- Time to reach key milestones
- Player retention at progression gates
- Satisfaction surveys

### Adjustment Mechanisms
- [To be defined]
- Data-driven balance updates
- A/B testing for progression changes
