## Leveling Mechanics

### XP System

- **Reset**: XP resets to zero when leveling up
- **Formula**: Uses a formula to determine XP required for next level
- **Scaling**: XP requirements increase with level

### Level Benefits
- **Item Unlocks**: Higher levels unlock new items in the [[../Economy/Shop|shop]]
- **Offers Algorithm**: Level affects the [[../Economy/Shop#Offers System|offers system]] weighting
- **Progression Gates**: Certain features locked behind level requirements

---
### Shop Integration
- **Item Availability**: Items require minimum level to purchase
- **Offers Weighting**: Algorithm considers player level for offer generation
- **Rarity Access**: Higher levels may access rarer items

### Balance Considerations
- **Fair Progression**: Detailed in [[../Balance/Progression|balance documentation]]
- **Retention**: Level progression designed for [[../Balance/Player-Retention|player retention]]

### Future Considerations
