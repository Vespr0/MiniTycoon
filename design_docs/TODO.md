### Planned
- [ ] [Stocks system](Stocks) 🔼  
- [ ] The Market: Add quantity selector to buy a specific number of items🔽 
- [ ] Currently you can only see YOUR OWN drops and dropper effects, both things that are client only sent through requests⏫ 
- [ ] If you buy an offer you selected after it updated u will buy the new offer in that spot , which isnt untuitive behaivor🔽 
- [ ] Bug where if u spam store `B` the item selection module errors  and breaks🔽 (Requires low ping to trigger)
- [ ] Make ClientPlayerData more modular and elegant. Currently you have to manually add things in way that is kind of embarassing🔽 
- [ ] Search feature in Market
- [ ] Make placing items and moving them more responsive by making the visuals client side, ILL GET YOU DERPMONSTER.
- [ ] Reset related bugs 🔼 
- [ ] Apparently all the BillBoardsGUI are using Offset instead of scale (Size property) as you move away, the text will become larger. I'll suggest to add a permanently size and check (In the textlabel properties) if the "TextScaled" property is true (SUGGESTED)
- [ ] Item tips should be placed consistently either on the left or right
- [ ] Tool tips (Mostly necessary to describe the meaning of all the different ui tips) (SUGGESTED)
- [ ] Clicking menu icons on mobiel causes weird spring like jitter
- [ ] ItemSelection Menu has some problem related to The device safe area, even if i enable none in the device safe area settings there are still problems related to how hte position is calculated
- [ ] Reduce loading time as much as possible (Make loading status user friendly)🔼
