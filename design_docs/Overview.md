### Vision

Mini tycoon is a sandbox tycoon with unique features and mechanics. The selling point is a sandbox tycoon that's not linear and "boring" like Miners Haven but a dynamic and engaging approach that transforms the genre from a mostly incremental game to a ==strategy incremental== one. So the focus is on adding strategy. This means making more aspects of the game like the plot and the items more complex.

### Target Audience

The game is made for all audiences both very young and old. This means it should be simple to play but have deeper elements for those who crave them, without complicating the game.

### Core Gameplay Loop

The gameplay loop is: place [[Items]], earn [[Cash]] from selling [[Product]] in [[Forge]]s, buy items from the [[Shop]], repeat.
