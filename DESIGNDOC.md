### The Base
Mini tycoon is a sandbox tycoon with unique features and mechanics. The selling point is
a sandbox tycoon that's not linear and "boring" like Miners Haven but a dynamic and
engaging approach that transforms the genre from a mostly incremental game to a strategy incremental one. So the focus is on adding strategy. This means making more aspects of the game like the plot and the items more complex.

### The Gameplay
The gameplay loop is: place items, earn cash, buy items, repeat.
[Cash is the main currency of the game.]
You have a plot where you place items and earn cash by selling the products you produce.
[An item is an object placed by the player in their plot, it is stationary unless moved and can be of various types , the main types are “Dropper”,”Forge”,”Upgrader”,”Decoration”].
[A dropper is an item that produces product]
[Product is generated by droppers and can take many forms ,mostly that of ores]
[Forges are items that sell products for cash on contact.]
[A plot is an area that is assigned to the player when they join the server, however it’s form and items placed in it are saved so every time you join the plot will look the same.]

### The Plot
The plot is a 2D set of tiles , where only a portion that can be expanded with upgrades is usable by the player, only in that area can the player place items.
The set of tiles is composed of grass, sand, water and more. Only some items can be placed on water.
Most games of the genre have a plain concrete square, so this is an unconventional approach but not absurd as it is a pretty simple idea that has been done before just in different genres.
[A tile is a square part with size (size,1,size). In some specific cases it can have a more complex description but it will still be square and have the same height. For example: The water also has a thin part at the bottom under the blue water part]

### The Shop
The shop is probably the most unconventional and risky mechanic I’ve implemented for the game (from the developer perspective not the player’s). Usually games of the genre but also games with similar contexts have a linear shop where you see all the items or at least most of them ordered by price, so you know what to do, you know what you are gonna but next, you know what you are saving for.

In Mini Tycoon the shop is an “offers” system where every 5 minutes 8 items are proposed to you (offers get reset every time). A complex algorithm chooses both the items and the prices based on your current level, how many of a specific item you have and also a random element to make certain items rarer based on three lists, “ITEMS POOL” , “UTILITY POOL” and “SPECIAL POOL”. These lists contain: [itemName] = {recommended level,luck factor}.

The algorithm then calculates weight based on the recommended level and luck factor in relation to the other variables mentioned earlier. The items for the offers are chosen by picking random weights (If an item has more weights it’s more likely to be chosen). More specifically it chooses 5 from the item pool, 2 from the utility pool and 1 from 0the special pool.
For example it may generate “Coal Mine : 32$,Coal Mine : 32$,Coal Mine : 32$,Coal Mine : 32$, Conveyor 8$, Conveyor 8$, Tree: 12$”
This system is risky because it’s unconventional and hard to balance.
